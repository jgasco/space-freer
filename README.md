# space-freer

This is a Python script that is intended to run within the Pythonista app for iOS. It transfers images and videos from an iOS device photo library to an SMB server share. Images and videos older than a certain number of days, weeks, or years, can be optionally deleted from iOS device storage after they are transferred to the SMB server share. This, and other settings, can be configured in config.json.
